# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 21, Monday.

**Today's Progress**: Function to translate text from Russian to English, work with the function walk(), Markov chain.

**Thoughts** I wrapped the function to translate text from Russian into English, after the translated text is fss.ru, which I was being [parsed](https://github.com/makarevichy/Week_1_100DaysOfCode/Day_1/) yesterday, and also built a [Markov chain](https://github.com/makarevichy/Week_1_100DaysOfCode/blob/master/Day_2/markov_chain.txt).
